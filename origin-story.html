            <h2 id="section1">Section 1. Becoming a doctor</h2>
            <p>
                When I got my A level results, I was surprised. I guess I never thought I had options 
                to dream about traditional prestigious careers. So I was quite unprepared for 
                all the extra-curricular requirements and aptitude tests involved in dentistry college
                applications. By now, you would know the ending was that I was never successful 
                in getting into dentistry. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Why dentistry? Because I would be considered a specialist within 4 years, while medical
                school was 5 years, and at the end of it, you are still considered the bottom of a tall
                hierarchy ladder. And as a dentist, the moment you graduate, your work life will always be
                reasonable, unlike a junior doctor. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I ended up studying pharmacy overseas, because I couldn't qualify for dentistry and pharmacy 
                in Singapore (didn't try apply for med), 
                and I turned down TCM because using Mandarin in my training was too
                daunting for me.
            </p>
         <p>
             I initially hesitated to apply for medical school due to my fear of gore, 
             which I believed stemmed from exposure to Freddy Krueger films in my youth. 
         </p>
         <p>
             <i>
                 Side note: This concern proved unfounded when I discovered that assisting in 
             surgery was actually quite a pleasant experience. With all the draping and 
             taping, and only the surgical site exposed, the procedure felt surprisingly 
             sanitary and normal. The focus on specific body parts and the controlled 
             environment minimized any sense of bloodiness. In those moments, my only 
             thought was that the patient needed help, and I was participating in something 
             that could potentially solve their problem.
             </i>
         </p>
         <p>
             I enjoyed pharmacy well enough, learnt the art of compounding medications
             in various forms. It's not easy! Its like cooking, but no room for error. 
             Naive me then felt my prospects were limited as a pharmacist. (Back then,
             I was still quite homesick, and I had this assumption that in Singapore, only
             pharmacists with good academic scores get to work in hospitals, everyone 
             else had to settle for community retail stores.) Now I know after years of 
             working, community retail pharmacy can be great for work-life harmony. 
         </p>
            <p>
                So I decided that since I was coming back to Singapore to work straight after
                graduation, I should maximise my prospects by switching to medicine. 
            </p>
             <p>
                 <i>
                     (If you knew me well enough
                you would know that by the 4th year living in Australia, I fell in love with the country, and
                decided to stay and work. But life had other plans which eventually resulted me returning
                back to Singapore)
                 </i>
                <p>
                I applied to transfer to medicine in the university I was already studying in. And with 
                AUD$35k downpayment, it was too late to regret the decision. I had already wasted too
                much of my parents' money to question my decision. I had to graduate as a doctor.

            <h2 id="section2">Section 2. Returning to Singapore</h2>
              <p>
                As an optimistic young doctor who has experience working in Australia, 
                  I was excited to contribute 
                my knowledge and work style to Singapore's public healthcare system. When I started 
                my rotation in General Medicine at Khoo Teck Puat Hospital, I expected a similar 
                experience to my enjoyable times in Australia, where I learned from patients, 
                seniors, peers, and allied health professionals.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, I quickly faced a culture shock. Instead of a welcoming environment, 
                I encountered a lack of open communication and mutual respect. 
                Most consultants were unreceptive to my questions and input, 
                leaving no room for clarification or discussion regarding their decisions. 
                The hierarchical divide between junior and senior doctors was stark, and 
                the divide between doctors and allied health professionals was even more concerning.
            </p>
            <p>
               Allied health professionals were expected to treat doctors as infallible authorities, 
                carrying out orders without question or offering their expertise. When I sought 
                their opinions on patient care, they looked at me with bewilderment. Pharmacists 
                were surprised when I asked for their input on medication regimens tailored to patients' 
                unique physiology and presenting problems. Their response was often, "You're the doctor, 
                shouldn't you already know this?"
            </p>
            <p>
                It felt like a dystopian world where allied health professionals had lost their sense 
                of ownership and pride in their roles. Their reply would typically be, 
                "No opinion, nothing to say." Sadly, their valuable perspectives were suppressed, 
                resulting in a loss for patients who could have benefited from the 
                collective expertise of the healthcare team.
            </p>
            <p>
                I firmly believe that open communication, mutual respect, and collaborative 
                decision-making are essential for providing the best possible care. As healthcare professionals, 
                we should embrace each other's unique specialties and foster an 
                environment where diverse perspectives are valued and encouraged.

            <h2 id="section3">Section 3. Why I left the public healthcare system</h2>
             <p>
                 The work culture shock and other darker reasons elaborated 
                 <a href="whistleblow-sg-public-healthcare.html">here</a> were push factors
                 for my leaving the frontline healthcare work option. Pull factors for my current line of work
                 was the hope to eventually have an influence in the culture from another angle i.e. 
                 with technology. 
             </p>
             <p>
                 I had always wondered why some EMR systems could be a joy to work with, while
                 others were painful. Why some simple features I envisioned as a user could be easily
                 implemented were never implemented, or implemented unreliably. Now that I am on
                 the other side, I finally understand why. One of the major contributing blockers is 
                 a mismatch and misunderstanding in priorities and method of implementation 
                 between technical staff and clinical staff. 
             </p>
         <p>
                 I am reminded of this everytime I start work in the morning. It is my motivation
                 for the choice to pursue a path less taken than most people with a medical
                 degree. It is not to become venture capitalist, or a founder of startups, or a 
                 glorified chief executive or board member or medical sales liaison but to
                 be intimately involved in digital solutions to improve the work lives of my fellow
                 ex-colleagues, and hopefully also ensure safer and cost effective healthcare service 
                 delivery
                 for my fellow residents in Singapore.

         <h2 id="section4">Section 4. Transferring medical skills to data science</h2>
         <p>
             Now as a machine learning engineer, I have realized that many of my skills as a medical doctor
             transfer well to a career in data science. My analytical thinking, attention to detail, 
             and ability to interpret complex information have been applicable. I'm accustomed to 
             analyzing patient data, recognizing patterns, and making evidence-based decisions - 
             all crucial skills in data science.
         </p>
         <p>
             The scientific method and research skills I have honed in medicine translate 
             effectively to the data science workflow. I have been trained to form hypotheses, 
             design studies, collect and analyze data, and draw conclusions - a process very similar
             to the data science approach. Additionally, my experience with statistical analysis 
             and interpreting research papers provides a solid foundation for more 
             advanced data science concepts.
         </p>
         <p>
             While transitioning to data science had required me to learn new technical skills 
             like programming and machine learning algorithms, my existing knowledge of 
             healthcare systems and medical terminology were particularly valuable in my current
             healthcare-related data science role. My domain expertise allows me to ask 
             relevant questions, understand the context of the data, and derive 
             meaningful insights in this field. 
         </p>
         <p>
             I can easily communicate with healthcare professionals and understand 
             the context of their product feature requests without needing 
             extensive elaboration. I can identify which features are critical 
             to get right and which can be modified to work around technical and 
             infrastructure limitations while still empowering healthcare providers 
             to be more effective in fulfilling their responsibilities.
         </p>
         <hr class="separator">
         <h2 id="section5">Section 5. Parallels between medicine and data science</h2>
         <p>
             Both fields rely heavily on pattern recognition. In medicine, doctors analyze symptoms, 
             lab results, and medical histories to identify diseases. Similarly, data scientists 
             examine large datasets to uncover trends and insights. This skill of spotting 
             meaningful patterns amidst complex information is crucial in both domains.
         </p>
         <p>
             Evidence-based decision making is fundamental to both medicine and data science. 
             Doctors use clinical studies and established guidelines to inform treatment 
             decisions. Data scientists similarly base their conclusions on statistical 
             evidence and empirical data. Both professions require a rigorous approach to 
             interpreting information and drawing actionable conclusions.
         </p>
         <p>
             The scientific method underpins both disciplines. In medicine, hypotheses 
             about diseases or treatments are tested through clinical trials. In data science, 
             hypotheses about data relationships or predictive models are tested through 
             statistical analysis and machine learning experiments. This systematic approach 
             to problem-solving is a core similarity between the two fields.
         </p>
         <p>
             Continuous learning and adaptation are essential in both medicine and data science. 
             Medical knowledge evolves rapidly with new research, requiring doctors to 
             stay updated. Similarly, data science techniques and technologies are 
             constantly advancing, demanding ongoing education from practitioners. This 
             shared need for lifelong learning reflects the dynamic nature of both fields.
         </p>
          <hr class="separator">
         <h2 id="section6">Section 6. Vision for Health Tech future</h2>
         <p>
             My vision for the future of healthcare technology is one of seamless 
             integration and personalization. I see a world where patient data flows 
             effortlessly between devices and systems, creating a comprehensive health 
             profile that evolves in real-time. This interconnected ecosystem would 
             enable more accurate diagnoses, personalized treatment plans, and 
             proactive health management.
         </p>
         <p>
             Artificial intelligence will play a crucial role in this future. 
             AI-powered diagnostic tools will assist healthcare providers, 
             analyzing vast amounts of data to identify patterns and potential 
             issues before they become serious. These systems will not replace 
             human expertise but augment it, allowing healthcare professionals to

             of patients' physiological 
             systems will allow healthcare providers to simulate and predict how 
             individuals might respond to various treatments or interventions. 
             By running countless scenarios on these digital models, we will be able 
             to identify the most effective and least risky treatment options for each patient. 
         </p>
         <h3 id="section6-4">6.4 Preventive healthcare for the individual</h3>
         <p>
             Digital twins integrated with up-to-date population attributes and 
             health statistics can 
             also play a crucial role in preventive care, allowing us 
             to model the long-term impacts of lifestyle choices and potential health risks. 
             This technology will empower patients to make more informed decisions about 
             their health and enable healthcare providers to deliver truly personalized 
             care at an unprecedented level of precision.
         </p>
         <h3 id="section6-5">6.5 Cost optimisation in healthcare institutions</h3>
         <p>
             Closer to personal experience, digital twins of healthcare institutions 
             can revolutionize operational efficiency and patient safety. 
             These virtual replicas can simulate various scenarios to optimize 
             staff scheduling, equipment utilization, and patient flow, reducing 
             operating costs and wait times.    
         </p>
         <p>
             They can monitor and predict supply chain needs in real-time, 
             preventing shortages and minimizing waste. 
             For infection control, digital twins can track the movement 
             of people and equipment, simulating the spread of 
             hospital-acquired infections and identifying high-risk areas 
             or procedures. 
         </p>
         <p>
             This allows for proactive intervention 
             strategies, such as adjusting cleaning protocols or 
             patient placement. By providing a holistic 
             view of the entire healthcare facility, 
             digital twins enable data-driven decision-making 
             that improves resource allocation, enhances patient care, 
             and ultimately leads to better health outcomes while controlling costs.

         <h3 id="section6-6">6.6 Safer and faster drug discovery</h3>
         <p>
             In the future, AI-driven drug and protein discovery could revolutionize 
             personalized medicine for cancer, congenital, and autoimmune diseases. 
             Advanced machine learning algorithms will analyze vast datasets of genetic 
             information, protein structures, and patient outcomes to design highly 
             targeted therapies. These treatments will be tailored to an individual's unique 
             genetic makeup and disease profile, maximizing efficacy while minimizing 
             side effects.              
         </p>
         <p>
             For cancer, this might mean developing drugs that precisely target tumor cells 
             without harming healthy tissue. In congenital diseases, we could 
             see gene therapies that correct specific mutations with pinpoint accuracy. 
             For autoimmune conditions, AI could help create treatments that 
             modulate the immune system without compromising its overall function. 
         </p>
         <p>
             The combination of AI-driven research and advanced manufacturing 
             techniques like 3D printing of drugs could dramatically reduce 
             development and production costs once they become more mainstream 
             technologies. This could make 
             curative, side-effect-free treatments accessible to the 
              general population, potentially through government-subsidized 
             programs or new insurance models designed to cover these 
             possibly long-term cost effective but higher upfront cost therapies.
         </p>
         <p>
             The result would be a healthcare landscape where chronic diseases 
             become manageable or even curable conditions, significantly 
             improving quality of life and reducing the long-term burden 
             on healthcare systems.
