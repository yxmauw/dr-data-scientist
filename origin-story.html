            <h2 id="section1">Section 1. Leaving the system</h2>
            <p>
                As an optimistic young doctor with experience in Australia, I was excited to contribute 
                my knowledge and work style to Singapore's public healthcare system. When I started 
                my rotation in General Medicine at Khoo Teck Puat Hospital, I expected a similar 
                experience to my enjoyable times in Australia, where I learned from patients, 
                seniors, peers, and allied health professionals.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, I quickly faced a culture shock. Instead of a welcoming environment, 
                I encountered a lack of open communication and mutual respect. 
                Most consultants were unreceptive to my questions and input, 
                leaving no room for clarification or discussion regarding their decisions. 
                The hierarchical divide between junior and senior doctors was stark, and 
                the divide between doctors and allied health professionals was even more concerning.
            </p>
            <p>
               Allied health professionals were expected to treat doctors as infallible authorities, 
                carrying out orders without question or offering their expertise. When I sought 
                their opinions on patient care, they looked at me with bewilderment. Pharmacists 
                were surprised when I asked for their input on medication regimens tailored to patients' 
                unique physiology and presenting problems. Their response was often, "You're the doctor, 
                shouldn't you already know this?"
            </p>
            <p>
                It felt like a dystopian world where allied health professionals had lost their sense 
                of ownership and pride in their roles. Their reply would typically be, 
                "No opinion, nothing to say." Sadly, their valuable perspectives were suppressed, 
                resulting in a loss for patients who could have benefited from the 
                collective expertise of the healthcare team.
            </p>
            <p>
                I firmly believe that open communication, mutual respect, and collaborative 
                decision-making are essential for providing the best possible care. As healthcare professionals, 
                we should embrace each other's unique specialties and foster an 
                environment where diverse perspectives are valued and encouraged.
            </p>
            <h3 id="section1-1">
                1.1 Dangerous shift hours
            </h3>
            <p>
                One of the major factors that contributed to my decision to leave the public healthcare system 
                in Singapore was the alarming practice of subjecting junior doctors to grueling 36-hour shifts, 
                commonly known as "Full-calls." These shifts typically lasted from 6:30 AM on the first day 
                until 12:30 PM or 1:00 PM the following day, leaving minimal opportunities for 
                adequate rest and recovery.
            </p>
            <p>
                During these extended shifts, the chances of getting quality sleep were slim to none. 
                Out of the approximately 35 full-calls I experienced, the best shift granted me only 
                3 hours of continuous sleep â€“ an extreme rarity. Unsurprisingly, morale among junior 
                doctors, including house officers, registrars, and those subjected to these full-calls, 
                was quite low.
            </p>
            <p>
                What baffled me the most was the stark contrast in perspectives between colleagues 
                who had trained or worked overseas and those who had not. For my colleagues who never 
                ventured beyond Singapore's healthcare system, the abnormal had become the norm. 
                It boggled my mind when they believed that hospitals functioning in such a manner was 
                considered normal practice. The unhealthy work culture and unsafe conditions were so 
                ingrained that they failed to recognize the need for change.
            </p>
            <p>
                The situation escalated to the point where some doctors began calling in sick on the 
                days they were scheduled for full-calls, leading to the implementation of backup 
                on-call doctors as part of the regular schedule. Disturbingly, even the first-level 
                backup on-call doctors began calling in sick, necessitating the involvement of 
                second-level backups.
            </p>
            <p>
                Alarmingly, the hospital often failed to provide courtesy or advance warning to 
                the backup doctors about their overnight duty. I vividly remember an incident where 
                I unexpectedly found my name on the roster for an overnight shift, with no prior 
                notification. This lack of consideration and communication from the hospital was 
                unacceptable and deeply concerning.
            </p>
            <p>
                The risks associated with sleep deprivation, particularly in the healthcare industry, 
                cannot be overstated. Numerous studies have shown that being awake for extended 
                periods can impair cognitive function to levels comparable to alcohol intoxication. 
                For instance, being awake for 24 hours is similar to having a blood alcohol 
                concentration (BAC) of 0.10%, exceeding Singapore's legal drink-driving limit of 0.08%.
            </p>
            <p>
                Alarmingly, at any given time in Singapore's public hospitals, a significant proportion 
                of doctors were making critical decisions regarding patients' lives and treatment plans 
                while operating under cognitive impairment levels akin to alcohol intoxication. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Furthermore, chronic sleep deprivation is known to increase the risk of cardiovascular 
                disease and certain cancers. Ironically, healthcare workers subjected to these conditions 
                may contribute more than the average person to Singapore's disease burden in their later 
                years due to the occupational hazards they endure.
            </p>
            <p>
                It is crucial to acknowledge that junior doctors often serve as the first point of contact 
                for patients in public hospitals, making initial decisions about investigations and 
                treatments before a consultant reviews the case. Any mistakes made under the influence 
                of sleep deprivation could have severe consequences for patient care.
            </p>
            <p>
                Ultimately, I could not reconcile myself with the dysfunctional work culture and 
                unsafe practices that not only jeopardized the health and well-being of healthcare 
                staff but also put patients at risk. This realization, coupled with the inefficiencies 
                in administrative tasks and outdated medical record systems, led me to the difficult 
                decision to leave the system.
            </p>
            <h3 id="section1-2">
                1.2 The Cost of Fear: Compromising Patient Care
            </h3>
            <p>
                Another significant factor that contributed to my decision to leave the public 
                healthcare system in Singapore was the lack of support, open communication, and 
                accountability within the organizational culture.
            </p>
            <p> 
                During my time working as a doctor in Australia, I experienced a collaborative 
                and supportive environment. When faced with challenges, such as working late 
                due to a registrar's inefficient patient rounds, the nursing staff would lodge 
                formal complaints on my behalf, recognizing the strain I was under. Superiors 
                were open to answering questions and even adjusting management plans based on 
                input from junior doctors.
            </p> 
            <p>
                However, this supportive atmosphere was sorely missing in Singapore's public 
                health system. Instead, a rigid hierarchy prevailed, characterized by 
                blame-shifting and a reluctance to speak up due to fear of retaliation. 
                Junior doctors who made decisions deviating from a consultant's plan, 
                even after grueling 36-hour shifts, were often subjected to berating 
                phone calls from the primary care team, not for educational purposes but 
                solely to chastise them without explaining the rationale behind the 
                consultant's approach.
            </p>
            <p>
                This toxic environment led to a common practice among medical officers, 
                registrars, and even house officers â€“ maintaining separate phone 
                subscriptions to disconnect from work during off-hours, avoiding 
                unnecessary and demoralizing reprimands.
            </p>
            <p>
                Disturbingly, these reprimands were frequently not conducted by the 
                consultants themselves but carried out by their subordinates under 
                instructions, or by individuals who had been berated and then asked 
                to convey the same treatment to their colleagues who were already 
                off-duty. This indirect and cowardly approach to communication was 
                unprofessional and detrimental to fostering a healthy work environment.
            </p>
            <p>
                Consequently, staff morale suffered as individuals became defensive 
                and fearful of making mistakes. Only the consultants possessed a 
                comprehensive understanding of the rationale behind investigations 
                and interventions for patients, while others had fragmented information. 
                Patients and their families were often left in the dark, unable to 
                fully comprehend or comment on treatment plans unless they had inside 
                knowledge of the system.
            </p>
            <p>
                Treatment plan designs became a top-down approach, with consultants 
                escaping accountability unless there were overt cases of medical 
                negligence or misconduct. Even in personal situations, such as 
                when my grandmother was a patient, my insider knowledge only provided 
                limited power to ensure her best interests were served, as direct 
                communication with the consultant was difficult, and instructions were 
                inconsistently followed due to fear of deviating from protocol.
            </p>
            <p>
                The rigid hierarchical structure created an environment where even 
                the nursing staff were too afraid to raise concerns or facilitate 
                communication between doctors and patients' families. In one instance, 
                when I objected to unnecessary investigations, tests, and measurements 
                for my grandmother's care, the nursing staff did not feel empowered to 
                request the doctors to directly address my concerns. Similarly, 
                junior doctors were too fearful to convey my wishes to the consultant, 
                and the notion of speaking contrary to the consultant was practically 
                unheard of â€“ an absurd state of affairs.
            </p>
            <p>
                It was only during the ward round when I managed to converse with 
                the consultant directly that my requests were acknowledged and 
                agreed upon. However, even then, there was a flaw â€“ the instructions 
                were not consistently followed because everyone was so focused on 
                strictly adhering to protocol to avoid potential reprimands from the consultant.
            </p> 
            <p>
                This lack of open communication, support, and accountability within the 
                healthcare system hindered the delivery of quality patient care and 
                fostered an unhealthy work environment. It became evident that leaving 
                the system was necessary to preserve my professional integrity and well-being.
            </p>
            <p>
                This breakdown in communication and the pervasive culture of fear hindered 
                the delivery of quality patient care. Nursing staff, junior doctors, 
                and even patients' families felt unable to voice their concerns or 
                advocate for appropriate care due to the risk of repercussions from 
                higher authorities. Ultimately, this lack of open dialogue and accountability 
                within the healthcare system fostered an unhealthy work environment and compromised 
                the well-being of both patients and staff members.
            </p>
            <h3 id="section1-3">
                1.3 The Hierarchical Culture in Healthcare: Stifling Collaboration
            </h3>
            <p>
                I argue that electronic medical records (EMRs) prioritize medicolegal defense 
                over ensuring effective transfer of patient information. Much useful data about 
                a patient's care, such as family dynamics, personality traits, and strategies to 
                improve treatment adherence, are often omitted from records due to concerns over 
                political correctness.
            </p>
            <p>
                Nurses and junior doctors appear reluctant to contradict consultants or voice 
                differing opinions, even when advocating for family wishes. This hierarchical 
                culture impedes open collaboration and negatively impacts patient care, 
                a persistent issue since I last worked in the system.
            </p>
            <p>
                Seeking rationale behind management decisions from nurses and junior staff 
                often prove futile. For instance, when questioning the need to continuously 
                measure a patient's blood pressure despite no plan to treat it, the 
                response would simply be along the line of "it's protocol, and the doctor wants it." My 
                requests to speak directly with the responsible doctor were always met with resistance. 
            </p>
            <p>
                To persuade staff to comply with my requests, I had to explicitly instruct them to 
                document my desired actions, asserting that such documentation would provide legal 
                protection for carrying out those requests. Even with this assurance, staff remained 
                hesitant to deviate from the doctor's directives. Consequently, I would request to directly 
                communicate with the physician responsible for the decision-making. However, staff 
                consistently exhibited reluctance to facilitate such direct conversations between 
                myself and the doctor concerning my requests. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Crucially, junior doctors do not receive adequate explanations for senior doctors' 
                decisions, hindering their ability to develop their own clinical judgment and determine 
                the kind of doctor they aspire to become.

                The lack of interdisciplinary collaboration and transparent communication ultimately 
                undermines patient care within the public healthcare system.

                1.4 Disempowerment of Junior Staff and Allied Health Professionals Undermines Patient Care
            </h3>
            <p>
                While hierarchical structures within hospitals can provide workflow guidance and clarity 
                around accountability, an overly rigid hierarchy can be detrimental, particularly when 
                it inhibits open communication and exchange of ideas across roles. Unfortunately, this 
                toxic dynamic plagues the Singapore public healthcare system, where communication is 
                predominantly top-down.
            </p>
            <p>
                Allied health professionals and junior staff often feel disempowered to voice their 
                perspectives, opinions, or provide input that may contradict or challenge the 
                consultants' directives. This one-way communication flow stifles valuable insights 
                from those closest to patient care.
            </p>
            <p>
                Rather than fostering a collaborative environment that leverages the diverse 
                expertise across disciplines, the entrenched hierarchical culture has created an 
                environment where junior staff and allied health professionals are expected to 
                simply execute orders without question or discourse.
            </p>
            <p>
                This lack of empowerment not only hinders professional growth and development 
                but also raises concerns about the quality of patient care. When frontline providers 
                cannot freely contribute their unique perspectives and lived experiences, 
                opportunities for optimizing treatment plans and addressing patient needs may be overlooked.
            </p>
            <p>
                Ultimately, the Singapore public healthcare system's rigid hierarchical culture 
                impedes the free flow of ideas, stymies interprofessional collaboration, and disempowers 
                those closest to patient care, potentially compromising the quality and comprehensiveness 
                of care delivered.

                1.5 Prioritizing Patient-Centered Care Over Rigid Protocol Adherence
            </h3>
            <p>
                While protocols offer benefits like streamlined processes and reduced cognitive load, 
                an overreliance on them can impede patient-centered care. Medicine is an intrinsically 
                human endeavor, dealing with unique individuals whose needs and responses to treatment 
                may vary. Rigidly adhering to protocols without considering each patient's physiology, 
                goals, and circumstances undermines truly personalized care.
            </p>
            <p>
                I've noticed a concerning fixation among staff on blindly following protocols, 
                likely driven by a blame culture where deviations are met with repercussions before 
                situational understanding. This "shoot first, ask questions later" approach discourages 
                critical thinking and flexibility.
            </p>
            <p>
                Common justifications like "it's the institution's protocol" fail to provide valid clinical 
                rationale. Protocols should serve as reference points, not inviolable rules. 
                In the era of artificial intelligence, doctors who rigidly adhere to guidelines without 
                accounting for individual patient circumstances are no better than AI systems blindly 
                following protocols designed for idealized scenarios divorced from real-world practice's 
                complexities. True empathetic clinicians, however, cannot be replaced by AI, as they possess 
                the ability to tailor care to the complexities and nuances of real-world practice,
                going beyond mere guideline implementation.
            </p>
            <p>
                I frequently find myself questioning the reasoning behind certain protocol-driven actions 
                that seem disconnected from patient needs. For instance, why require an ECG trace to 
                determine if a patient is dead? Isn't the absence of breathing, heart sounds/central pulse 
                for more than 5 minutes, absence of pupillary response to light, no response to touch/voice/pain
                (central painful stimulus), coupled with the obvious sign of the body becoming ambient temperature, 
                more than enough to certify death? Requiring ECG confirmation when other definitive signs of death 
                are already present seems unnecessary. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Guidelines aim to reduce cognitive load for providers, but 
                their judicious application requires incorporating the patient's and family's perspectives along 
                with clinical judgement, rather than blindly following protocols divorced from real-world scenarios.
            </p>
            <p>
                Truly patient-centered care necessitates striking a balance - utilizing protocols as helpful 
                frameworks while maintaining the flexibility to tailor management plans to each person's 
                unique situation. An excessive institutional emphasis on unwavering protocol adherence 
                compromises our ability to humanize healthcare delivery.
