                Section 1. The hospital admission ordeal
            </h2>
            <p>
                One Thursday evening, I received news that my grandmother had been admitted to a public 
                hospital in Singapore. The stated trigger was a potential lung infection, though later 
                it seemed this was exaggerated due to caregiver burnout, aiming to prioritize her admission.
            </p>
            <p>
                From the outset, there was a lack of clarity around the goals of care. 
                Practicing defensive medicine, the doctors proceeded with interventions 
                that I strongly disagreed with. This prompted me to take over decision-making 
                for my grandmother.
            </p>
            <p>
                The situation took an unexpected turn when concerns arose about her potentially 
                having active pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB), complicating plans for her discharge 
                to an institutional care facility.
            </p>
            <p>
                What ensued was a prolonged and emotionally turbulent journey that finally concluded 
                on May 18th, 2024. Throughout this arduous experience, I grappled with a range of 
                thoughts and sentiments:
            </p>
            <h3 id="section1-1">
                1.1 The Harsh Reality: Advocating for Personalized Care Requires Direct Physician Engagement
            </h3>
            <p>
                If I wanted any changes made to my grandmother's treatment plan, interventions or monitoring, 
                I realized the harsh truth - no nurse, allied health professional or junior doctor was truly 
                going to advocate on our behalf. They seemed too fearful of offending the consultants, as 
                their performance reviews likely depended on staying in their good graces.
            </p>
            <p>
                My best chance to have our voices heard was to catch the consultant directly during ward 
                rounds. Those typically happened early morning around 7:30am and could drag on until lunch 
                depending on caseload. I learned the isolation ward's prime window was 9-9:30am.
            </p>
            <p>
                I tried calling the hospital hotline to at least reach someone on the medical team, 
                but that proved useless. I only ever got through to a nurse providing scripted, 
                patronizing responses about protocol rather than facilitating any actual communication 
                with the doctors.
            </p>
            <p>
                It became abundantly clear that if we wanted personalized care accounting for my 
                grandmother's needs and our family's preferences, I would have to persistently pursue 
                face-to-face opportunities to directly engage the consulting physician. Relying on other 
                staff to properly convey our perspectives seemed futile. The onus was on me to 
                forcefully insert our voices into her care process.

                1.2 Fragmented Care: Rotating Consultants and the Breakdown of Continuity
            </h3>
            <p>
                In the isolation ward, consultants rotate on a weekly basis, likely an attempt to 
                minimize staff exposure and infection risk. While the electronic medical record (EMR) 
                system appears to facilitate the transfer of pertinent case details across teams, 
                communication breaks down when aspects fall outside the realm of "protocol."
            </p>
            <p>
                The primary purpose of EMRs seems to be ensuring medicolegal protection for staff 
                rather than seamlessly transitioning care to provide the best possible treatment for 
                the patient. Details recorded must remain "politically correct," lest the hospital 
                throw providers "under the bus" in litigations.
            </p>
            <p>
                From my perspective as a trained physician, this practice of frequently rotating 
                doctors deprives junior medical trainees of invaluable opportunities to witness 
                and learn from longitudinal patient cases firsthand. While they can study case 
                histories for presentations, nothing compares to directly interacting with patients 
                and families throughout their healthcare journey.
            </p>
            <p>
                In this system, junior doctors rotate alongside the consultants they are assigned to, 
                following whichever new cases are allocated to that attending physician. 
                This disrupts continuity of care and hinders their professional development.
            </p>
            <p>
                My personal growth as a clinician was profoundly shaped by experiences following 
                patients over extended periods. It provided a holistic understanding of what constitutes 
                truly excellent medical practice â€“ something the current staffing model 
                may be failing to impart.

                1.3 Panic over expected death
            </h3>
            <p>
                Hospital protocols, while generally helpful, can become a significant impediment when 
                it comes to respecting family members' wishes for their loved one's end-of-life experience. 
                Regular monitoring of vital signs like temperature, pulse, respiration, blood pressure, 
                and oxygen saturation is standard practice for assessing treatment response. However, 
                for patients like my grandmother, whose goals shift from curative to comfort-focused care, 
                adhering rigidly to such protocols proves counterproductive.
            </p>
            <p>
                My grandmother was cachexic and in stage 5 renal failure, ineligible for dialysis, 
                transplantation, or invasive procedures. Initially, due to unclear communication of 
                her wishes, the medical team treated her with curative intent. This led to a barrage 
                of tests - blood work, imaging, and even a CT scan to investigate internal bleeding 
                despite her unsuitability for surgical intervention.
            </p>
            <p>
                Tests found incidental anaemia and thrombocytaemia which led to more interventions. 
                She underwent a platelet transfusion that promptly crashed her blood pressure, 
                necessitating high-risk fluid resuscitation that her compromised renal function could scarcely
                tolerate. The rationale for rechecking her platelet levels post-transfusion seemed questionable 
                given her inability to undergo further transfusions safely.
            </p>
                This cascade of interventions proved highly distressing for my fragile grandmother, 
                leaving her plagued by nightmares and chilled despite double blankets - a far cry 
                from a peaceful end-of-life experience. I couldn't fathom the reasoning behind 
                these seemingly unnecessary investigations and lack of satisfactory explanations 
                from clinical staff to my mother.
            </p>
            <p>
                Ultimately, I intervened to directly communicate with the medical team, aiming 
                to establish clearer accountability and ensure care aligned with my grandmother's 
                needs and our family's wishes during her final days.
            </p>
            <h3 id="section1-4">
                1.4 Humanizing End-of-Life Care: Moving Beyond Rigid Protocols
            </h3>
            <p>
                When a patient is actively dying and the goals of care shift to palliation, 
                adhering blindly to protocols that mandate measuring vital signs serves little 
                purpose beyond creating unnecessary distress. For my grandmother, whose peripheral 
                circulation was shutting down, obsessively pursuing blood pressure readings 
                and oxygen saturation levels added no value to her care.
            </p>
            <p>
                While remote monitoring can be reasonable during periods of reduced bedside presence, 
                I struggled to comprehend the fixation on obtaining blood pressure readings when 
                it was glaringly apparent she was nearing death's doorstep. This misguided focus 
                culminated in a distressing incident where nurses, alarmed by her immeasurable 
                pulse on standard equipment, wheeled in a crash cart despite my grandmother's 
                obvious breathing pattern.
            </p>
            <p>
                Their panic seemed to stem from an excessive reliance on numeric vital signs 
                rather than applying clinical judgement â€“ neglecting the fundamental principle 
                that breathing precedes pulse assessment for initiating life-saving measures. 
                Worse, they disregarded my explicit wishes against uncomfortable procedures and were 
                dishonest about attempting blood pressure measurements.
            </p>
            <p>
                Throughout this experience, I continuously encountered the frustrating justification 
                of "it's protocol" from staff, suggesting an alarmingly rigid adherence to 
                standardized processes without thoughtful consideration for each patient's 
                unique condition and circumstances. This robotic approach undermines the 
                very essence of medical training by discounting critical thinking and clinical 
                reasoning in favor of blindly following directives akin to an artificial 
                intelligence system simply executing programmed rules.
            </p>
            <p>
                Another concerning protocol was the requirement for ECG confirmation before 
                certifying death, causing unnecessary anguish for families witnessing their 
                loved ones growing cold while awaiting the arbitrary designation of asystole. 
                As a physician, I've been on the other side of this devastating experience, 
                struggling to provide closure to distraught families based solely on bureaucratic 
                criteria divorced from human compassion.
            </p> 
            <p>
                Truly humanizing end-of-life care necessitates transcending inflexible protocols 
                that prioritize bureaucracy over dignity. It requires healthcare professionals 
                to apply clinical acumen, empathy, and ethical judgment when established guidelines 
                conflict with a patient's circumstantial needs and a family's wishes during 
                this sacred transition.

                1.5 Forcing Suffering: When Palliative Care Isn't Enough
            </h3>
            <p>
                The experience with my grandmother's end-of-life care was truly heart-wrenching. 
                She suffered from advanced dementia, and caring for her at home had become unmanageable 
                for my mother. We simply wanted to transfer her to a long-term care facility. However, 
                an upper lobe cavitating lung lesion raised 
                concerns about her potentially having pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB).
            </p>
            <p>
                No nursing home or long-term 
                care facility could accept someone with suspected active TB and not undergo TB 
                treatment, even if death was imminent within 6 months. Home hospice wasn't an option either 
                if we refused the TB treatment, as that 
                would expose their staff to someone with untreated presumed active TB. The only choice was to subject 
                my very frail grandmother to a harsh 6-9 month TB treatment regimen with toxic side effects
                to the kidneys, liver and eyes that would likely hasten her death from organ failure 
                rather than the suspected TB itself.
            </p>
            <p>
                Part of TB treatment required obtaining samples for TB testing and culture for 
                antimicrobial sensitivities before commencing empirical treatment.
                The process of even obtaining samples to test for TB was traumatic. 
                With her dementia, the only way to get respiratory samples was through an invasive gastric lavage 
                procedure - inserting a tube through a nostril, pharynx, oesophagus and 
                into her stomach, leaving the NGT in-situ
                for multiple days to get 3 good quality early morning NG aspirates. 
                Fortunately she was cooperative, and 
                did not require repeated NGT insertions. 
                The other option, sputum induction was not an option due to her dementia.
            </p>
            <p>
                TB PCR result was negative. Acid-Fast Bacillus smear-positive. Culture is pending 8 weeks from
                time of collection. 
            </p>
            <p>
                There is no room for palliative, comfort-focused end-of-life care for suspected 
                active TB patients in Singapore. Everyone has to undergo treatment, even if the family's goal is 
                just to keep their terminally-ill loved one comfortable until the end. It forced me into an 
                impossibly difficult decision that I felt was inhumane for my grandmother's condition.
            </p>
            <p>
                I had to make the agonizing choice to pursue a path of treatment that would accelerate her 
                decline and suffering rather than allow her a peaceful death from her terminal dementia. 
                If only euthanasia were legal in Singapore, we could have spared her that traumatic final ordeal. 
                It was an experience that made me wish deeply for the option of medical aid in dying 
                for terminally ill patients suffering unbearably.

                1.6 The Bare Minimum: Dealing with Doctors' Reluctance to Share Details
            </h3>
            <p>
                Engaging with most doctors in Singapore's public healthcare system is an uphill battle
                when it comes to open communication. It's akin to pulling teeth - in fact, 
                I think an actual dental extraction would be more straightforward!
            </p>
            <p> 
                Whenever I ask an open-ended question, like inquiring about the full palliative care 
                management plan, the responses I receive are woefully incomplete. Doctors tend to give 
                bare-bones answers like "we just use subcutaneous fentanyl here." As someone with experience 
                supporting palliative patients, I know there has to be more to it than that. It's only 
                after pressing them with follow-up questions, essentially prompting them like 
                a low-performing AI language model, that I finally get more comprehensive explanations.

            <p>
                Alternatively, I've found that asking extremely targeted questions can sometimes yield better 
                results. However, even then, most doctors seem reluctant to proactively provide 
                thorough information. Unless I demonstrate prior knowledge and ask about specifics, 
                they tend to volunteer only the bare minimum details.
            </p>
            <p>
                Overall, having an open discussion and getting full transparency into care plans is an 
                incredible challenge. Doctors are often closed off, requiring me to pry out every 
                piece of information bit-by-bit. As a patient or family member simply trying to understand 
                and participate in care decisions, this lack of communication is extremely frustrating. 
                Improving doctor-patient dialogue should be a priority for enhancing Singapore's healthcare experience.
