            <h2 id="section1">Section 1. Leaving the system</h2>
            <p>
                As a bright-eyed optimistic young doctor who had worked in Australia, I was excited to work
                in Singapore public healthcare to contribute my knowledge, training and work style. 
            </p>
            <p>
                When I was told my first rotation was General medicine in Khoo Teck Puat Hospital, I thought, 
                oh that's ok, I had enjoyable times doing general medicine when I was in Australia. Learnt
                a lot from patients and staff (seniors, peers, allied health)
            </p>
            <p>
                Later did I knew from the first week, the experience was entirely different. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I had a rude culture shock. Not only did most consultants not welcome my questions, they
                did not welcome any input. I could not clarify any rationale of their decisions, and
                was just told to do as they say. There was no mutual respect between junior drs and 
                the seniors, and even worse, no respect between allied health and doctors.
            </p>
            <p>
                Allied health were made to treat doctors as Gods, that doctors knew everything and
                allied health was just there to carry out orders.
            </p>
            <p>
                I was appalled by the entire culture. I was shocked when allied health looked at me
                strangely whenever I asked them about their opinion regarding a patient's care. 
                Pharmacists thought I was strange to ask for their opinion regarding medication regimes for patients
                given their unique physiology and presenting problems. Their answer was always: 
                "you are the doctor, shouldn't you already know this?" 
            </p>
            <p>
                It was a dystopian world. My reply would always be some where along the lines of, 
                "Yes, I am the doctor, I am trained as a doctor. But I am not trained as a pharmacist/
                dietitian/speech pathologist/occupational therapist/nurse. 
                You are a specialist in your own right, so tell me what is your opinion
                so that I can make a better decision for the patient?"
            </p>
            <p>
                The sad part was, because the oppressive culture was so ingrained, they no longer formed opinions. 
                Their reply would usually be "no opinion, nothing to say". For whatever reason, 
                they stopped taking 
                ownership and pride in their unique roles surrounding patient's care. And I knew patients' 
                were losing out on the best care they could have if not for this culture.
            </p>
            <h3 id="section1-1">
                1.1 Dangerous shift hours
            </h3>
            <p>
                Another surprise is the continued existence of 36 hours shifts a.k.a "Full-calls" since historic times. 
                They typically
                last between 6.30am on the first day and 12.30pm/1pm the next day. During this time, if you are 
                lucky, you get some good quality sleep at night. However, based on personal experience, that is an 
                extreme rarity. Out of my 35-ish full-calls, the best shift I had granted me 3 hours of continuous sleep.
            </p>
            <p>
                So morale amongst junior doctors (house officers all the way up to registrars are subjected to full-calls), 
                as you can imagine is quite low. It got so bad that some doctors just kept calling in sick on the days
                they were scheduled to have full-calls, and back-up on-call doctors became part of the regular schedule.
                Worse, the first level back-up on-call doctors were also calling in sick on the days they were
                scheduled as back-up, so 2nd level back-up on-call doctors became another part of the regular schedule.
            </p>
            <p>
                The sad thing was, the hospital had no courtesy or warning to notify the back-up doctor that they had
                to be on-duty overnight. I personally experienced it, on one afternoon, my colleague and I decided to 
                check who would be on-duty that day, so that we could do a handover for some patients that we thought
                were fragile, and could require some attention overnight.
            </p>
            <p>
                Lo and Behold, I was stunned to see my name there on the roster for that night. I knew I was not the
                doctor initially rostered. I had to make emergency preparations for overnight stay, which was quite
                upsetting. What upset me more was the lack of apology or courtesy by the hospital to at least give 
                me some advance notice. Call me entitled or whatever, but this is just not acceptable behaviour. 
            </p>
            <p>
                My colleagues who never trained or worked overseas, it always boggles my mind when they believe this
                is normal for hospitals to function this way. The abnormal is normal to them.
            </p>
            <p>
                Being in the healthcare industry, the health and occupational risks from sleep deprivation should
                be something considered in the work processes. However, in Singapore public healthcare, somehow, 
                I guess it got missed.
            </p>
            <p>
                Sleep deprivation is known to have similar impairment effects as alcohol intoxication. Being
                awake for 17 hours is similar to having a BAC of 0.05%. Being awake for 24 hours is similar to
                having a BAC of 0.10%. In Singapore, the legal drink-driving limit is BAC of 0.08%. So 
                essentially, at any one time, in Singapore public hospitals, there is a large proportion of
                doctors who are making decisions on patients' lives, treatment plans under cognitive levels 
                similar to being alcohol intoxicated. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Sleep deprivation also increases risk of cardiovascular disease and cancers. And so any staff that
                is subjected to these full-calls, the longer they experience them, the higher the risk
                of cardiovascular disease and malignancy in their later years. Unfortunately, there is no
                longitudinal study to show the association between healthcare workers subjected to 
                chronic sleep deprivation have a higher than population risk for cardiovascular disease or malignancy.
                It is ironic that healthcare workers would probably contribute more than the average person
                to Singapore's disease burden
                in their later years.
            </p>
            <p>
                Albeit these are junior staff, but they also tend to be the first doctor you get to interact with
                in the public hospital. They make the initial decisions on investigations and treatment, before 
                the consultant actually reviews the patient. So any mistakes made under sleep-deprived 
                impairment will already 
                be committed before the well-rested consultant comes. 
            </p>
            <p>
                So don't blame the junior doctors for medical errors. If there is anything to blame, it is the 
                dysfunctional public healthcare system.
            </p>
            <p>
                And that is why, I left the system. I could not agree with the work culture and the unsafe 
                work practices that not only put the health of healthcare staff at risk, but 
                ultimately also patients at risk. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Another pain point was the inefficiencies in the administrative tasks. Medical record systems were
                fragmented, unreliable, and outdated. Just to review a patient holistically could take referencing 4 to 5 applications
                at the same time. And not all applications could be working on the same computer. Some work in one, the
                others could work in another, and then I end up using mutliple computers at the same time / or sequentially to get the
                information I need for just a single patient.
                I have worked with better EMR systems before. But that
                is a story for another post.
            </p>
            <h3 id="section1-2">
                1.2 Toxic work culture, so patients suffer
            </h3>
            <p>
                This is something that bugged me when I joined the public health system as a medical officer. And
                the contributing factor to me leaving.
            </p>
            <p> 
                I worked in Australia as a doctor before, there were ups and downs. But one thing that really helped me
                become a better doctor was being supported by the staff around me, not just the superiors but also the 
                allied health and nursing staff. When I had to work late because a registrar was not helpful in finishing
                his rounds with a subset of patients under our team's care, the nurses lodged a formal complaint on my 
                behalf just because they saw me after work hours.
            </p>
            <p>
                Superiors were more than happy to answer any questions regarding their management plans. Sometimes they
                even adjusted plans based on the junior drs' input. 
            </p>  
            <p>
                Such support is sorely missing in the Singapore public health system. There is just hierachy, with a lot
                of blaming that goes around. No one dares to speak up to one higher in rank because of fear of retaliation.
            </p>
            <p>
                When I was still in the system, I saw situations where doctors who have finished their 36 hour (full-call) 
                shift, left the hospital, resting or sleeping at home or something, being called up by the primary care 
                team for something trivial because he/she made a decision for a patient admitted under their team that
                deviated from the consultant's plan. And the call was not to educate the dr that was off-work, it was
                to chastise without telling he/she why the decision he/she made was wrong.
            </p>
            <p>
                This resulted in a common practice for medical officers, registrars and even house officers to have 2
                phone subscriptions, so that 1 could be turned off when they are off-work. And so they won't be subjected 
                to useless berating sessions.
            </p>
            <p>
                The worse part is these berating sessions are usually not even conducted by the consultant him/herself, but
                carried out by the minions because they were told to do so. Or they were berated first, and then were asked
                to convey the same to the colleague that is already off-work. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Now that is just childish, if you have a problem with someone, especially someone of lower-rank, 
                communicate directly instead of getting your minion to do your dirty work. 
            </p>
            <p>
                So staff morale is low, everyone is being defensive, afraid to get it wrong. The only one who has clear
                insight about why investigations and interventions are done to the patient is the consultant. Everyone else
                just has piecemeal information, and the patient and the family get the leftovers. 
            </p>
            <p>
                So the family nor the patient can't really comment about their treatment plan because they don't have the 
                full picture about what is happening to them. Unless they are fortunate enough to have some insider 
                knowledge, themselves having worked in the system, or a family member who has worked in the system or still
                working in the system.
            </p>
            <p>
                It becomes a top-down approach to treatment plans design, and the consultant escapes with minimal 
                accountability unless there is overt medical negligence or foul play. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Even for my situation, I can only settle for being unhappy that my grandmother is being treated just like
                any other case on the consultant's list. My insider knowledge gave me the power to know what is just 
                bullsh*t and what was truly necessary. Even then, it was still a struggle to ensure my requests were 
                followed to ensure the best interests of 
                my grandmother because it wasn't the consultant that I could speak to directly. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Nursing staff were too afraid to trouble the doctors, or even to ask the Drs to speak to me directly when
                I objected to unnecessary investigations, tests, and measurements. Junior Drs were too afraid to 
                convey my wishes to the consultant. And asking to speak to the consultant directly is also not possible.
                How ridiculous is that?
            </p>
            <p>
                And only when I talked to the consultant directly during ward round, then the 
                consultant agreed to my requests. The only flaw was that it didnt translate to consistent following of 
                instructions because everyone was just so focused on not deviating protocol so that they dont get 
                into trouble with the consultant.
            </p>

                1.3 Lack of staff collaboration and inter-communication, so patients suffer
            </h3>
            <p>
                So what you say, isn't there EMR to rely on? Yeah news flash, medical records are more for medicolegal 
                defence
                rather than ensuring useful transfer of information. Yes the information is still useful to train 
                machine learning
                algorithms and fancy LLMs. But that was not the main purpose. 
            </p>
            <p>
                A lot of useful information regarding a patient's care often get ommited in writing because it is not
                "politically correct". Information like family dynamics, patient's personality quirks, tips and tricks 
                to increase patient's compliance to treatment, often is ommitted. 
            </p>
            <p>
                 Nurses and junior drs seem to fear going against consultants. 
                 Or even to voice a different opinion or to advocate for family wishes. 
                 That hasn't changed since I last left the system. Quite unfortunate.
                 Patients are the ones left to suffer. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Asking nurses and junior staff for rationale behind management decisions is useless. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Why do you need to keep measuring BP in someone whose BP you are not going to treat? Oh because it is
                protocol and the dr wants it. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I want to speak to the dr who wants it. Uh....
            </p>
            <p>
                How about, you just document that patient's family made this request against the dr's wishes. 
                Then you will be legally covered. Or you could just let me speak with this Dr directly. 

                Uh....
            </p>
            <p>
                Junior drs don't learn the rationale behind decisions made by senior drs, 
                    which would help them in forming their internal compass about what kind of Dr 
                    they would want to be.

                1.4 Lack of empowerment to junior staff and allied health, so patients suffer
            </h3>
            <p>
                Culture of hierachy is strong within the hospital. It is not a bad thing when it
                does not inhibit communication and exchange of ideas/opinions/input between allied / junior
                staff and consultants. Because it gives a guide to workflow, and clarity to
                levels of accountability.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, in Singapore public healthcare system, the culture of hierachy has poisoned
                the system, such that there's mainly a one-way communication top-down. 
            </p>

            <h2>
                Protocol-driven rather than patient-centred
            </h2>
            <p>
                I get the benefits of protocols. Streamlined processes. Less cognitive load, like being an assembly
                line worker. Efficiency is optimised.
            </p>
            <p>
                But we are not cars. Medicine is not about treating machines, but humans. and no 1 human is exactly alike. 
                Not even identical twins. Even clones can still have spontenous mutations harboured within them. Anyway
                human clones don't exist yet (I hope not).
            </p>
            <p>
                So stop treating protocols like rules that cannot be broken, instead, use them
                as a reference point, and tailor management plans to each patient's unique 
                physiology, needs and goals of care.
            </p>
            <p>
                I noticed staff fixation on following protocols. Maybe because of the strong blame-culture where
                if protocols were not followed, there were repercussions without 
                people imposing the punishment first understanding the situation.
                Like shoot first, ask questions later sort of practice. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I found myself questioning rationale behind many actions driven by protocol. Why do you need an ECG
                trace to figure out if the patient is dead? Is absence of breathing, heart sounds/central pulse for
                more than 5 minutes, absence of 
                pupillary response 
                to light, no response to touch/voice/pain (central painful stimulus) 
                more than enough to certify death, and the obvious sign of 
                body becoming ambient temperature enough to know he/she is dead?
            </p>
            <p>
                The common cop-out reason given for decision rationale is because it is the "institution" protocol.
                That is not a valid rationale, because all decisions can be altered if the situation is 
                deemed suitable or change requested
            </p>
            <p>
                Protocols/guidelines are first point of reference for Drs to use to reduce cognitive load. 
                But what they do with the reference is entirely their choice, be it likened to a machine learning 
                algorithm, following everything by the book without considering the patient's/family's POV or 
                being an empathetic clinician that cannot be replaced by artificial intelligence
            </p>
            <p>
                Guidelines cover standard and/or ideal situations. When is medical practice ever ideal or involve 
                dealing with "standardised" patients? Perhaps only in randomised controlled trials with 
                strict inclusion and exclusion criteria, there is some form of standardisation. Which is 
                a very artificial arrangement, that does not exist in real world.

            <h2 id="section2">The hospital admission</h2>
            <p>
                Got the news one Thursday evening that my grandmother was admitted to a public hospital in Singapore. Oh,
                it was triggered by carer's fatigue, but posed as possible lung infection to instil perceived severe condition 
                to get priority. (well, she did have lung infection, so it is not entirely wrong)
            </p>
            <p>
                My mother (carer) was not clear with the goals of care, so the doctors covered their bases a.k.a 
                defensive medicine. 
                I got mad about the interventions done, so I took over the decision-making. Worse luck, she could not be
                discharged to institutional care because she might have active pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB). 
            </p>
            <p>
                It has been a long journey that ended on 18 May 2024. Emotions have been on a roller-coaster ride. 
                Here are my thoughts so far:
            </p>
            <hr class="separator">
            <h2>
                Staff think they know better, but they not always get it right, so speak up
            </h2>
            <p>
                If you want anything to change in your or famiily member's management plan / interventions / monitoring 
                measures, 
                you need to speak to the consultant directly. No nursing staff, allied health or junior doctor is
                gonna advocate for you/your family member better than you. They are too afraid to offend the 
                consultant because their performance review depends on it.
            </p>
            <p>
                Best way to speak to the consultant is to catch them during ward rounds. Ward rounds are usually in the
                morning, starting 7.30am and can last until lunch time depending on case load and disruptions. Some consultants
                like having a 2nd ward round before the end of day, but depends on ward culture. My personal experience is
                9am - 9.30am in isolation ward.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can try calling the hospital hotline (switchboard) to reach the doctor (any doctor in the team), but 
                the best I have gotten is the ward nurse. It was a useless endeavour. Basically a patronising template answer
                about protocol.
            </p>
            <hr class="separator">
            <h2>
                Lack continuity of care 
            </h2>
            <p>
                In the isolation ward, consultants are rotated every week. Maybe that is the hospital's way to minimise
                infection risk to staff. 
            </p>
            <p>
                So far, the EMR must be doing something right since pertinent points about my family member's case do seem
                to get across from team to team. But when it comes to things that don't fit in the nice picture of "protocol",
                then the communication breaks down. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Why? Because purpose of EMR is not so much about making sure care is transferred seamlessly, but to ensure 
                that staff is covered medicolegally if there are litigations.  Main use of the EMR is in medicolegal defense 
                rather than transfer of useful information to ensure best care for the patient is not disrupted.
                Everything in EMR has to be politically correct,
                or else the hospital is basically going to throw you under the bus if you get into trouble.
            </p>
            <p>
                Another unique perspective since I am trained as a medical doctor, is that such practice of rotating doctors 
                so frequently deprives junior doctors the opportunity to learn firsthand about longitudinal case histories.
                Yeah they can read about them when preparing for case presentations, but nothing is quite the same as
                actually interacting with the patient and their family throughout their hospital journey.
            </p>
            <p>
                I think junior drs here are still rotated around consultants and their specialty, 
                so if a consultant change, the junior drs will follow him/her to whichever are the 
                new cases assigned to that consultant.
            </p>
            <p>
                I know I learnt more when I got to follow patients through their health journey. 
                It gave me a more holistic picture about what good medical practice should be.

                Isolation room ambient temperature is customisable.

            <p>
                Hospital protocols are really sticky, they are great most times, but when it comes to respecting family 
                members' wishes for how they want their loved one to die, these protocols are a pain to deal with.
            </p>
            <p>
                Vital signs such as body temperature, pulse rate, respiratory rate, non-invasive blood pressure, oxygen 
                saturations are regularly measured in the hospital because they are the most basic way to monitor patient's 
                response to treatment. In patients with the goal to cure, or at least reach a baseline that can be managed 
                in the community, this would be appropriate.
            </p>
            <p>
                My grandmother was cachexic, with stage 5 renal failure. Not a candidate 
                for dialysis, transplant or even surgery. 
                Anyway, at the start of admission, my mother was not clear about
                what she wanted, so the medical team treated my grandmother with the goal to cure.
            </p>
            <p>
                So they did a bunch of tests - blood tests, chest X-ray.
                And they saw anaemia and thrombocytopaenia. 
                So they did a CT-scan without contrast to look for overt internal haemorrhage.
                Concurrently, they also transfused her with platelets, which promptly crashed her systolic BP. 
                Fortunately her BP responded to fluid resuscitation. However with her advanced renal failure, she
                probably would not tolerate another round of transfusion and fluid resuscitation.
                Eventually they managed to complete the tranfusion, likely at a slower rate (I wasnt there to witness)
            </p>
            <p>
                My grandmother didn't enjoy that day. 
                She had nightmares that night, and constantly felt cold despite 2 blankets. 
            </p>
            <p>
                It bugged me a lot thinking about the rationale for the CT scan. She is not a surgical candidate, so what
                if they found a bleed? what are they going to do about it? Will it change the management plan?
            </p>
            <p>
                And then there was the repeat blood test to check if she responded to platelet transfusion. 
                Already she did not tolerate the first transfusion well, any repeated transfusion is probably more a risk 
                than a benefit.
            </p>
            <p>
                So why do you need to check for response to platelet transfusion if nothing can be done even if it showed poor
                response?
            </p>
                I got mad about the entire saga of seeming unnecessary investigations, and lack of satisfactory explanations 
                given by the clinical staff to my mother. So I took over the communications with the medical team to get
                better accountability from them.

                Treat the patient, not the numbers.
            </h2>
            <p>
                It is ok not to measure BP in someone who is dying and goals of care does not include 
                resuscitative measures - be confident in using presence of pulse and breathing, 
                pupillary response to light, and response to pain/voice/touch as signs of life for monitoring.
                Ok so maybe you can't feel the radial pulse, try the carotid pulse. If all else fails, take the 
                stethoscope and auscultate for heart sounds.
            </p>
            <p>
                It is ok not to measure the oxygen saturation when there is peripheral circulatory shutdown, the
                patient is already on maximal non-invasive ventilation and for palliation. Especially when 
                the oxygen saturation becomes unmeasurable via pulse oximetry. No point pursuing getting a number. 
            </p>
            <p>
                My grandmother was dying, and peripheral circulation was shutting down. Her pulse became 
                unmeasureble on most pulse oximeters except on Phillips Intellivue, which was still able
                to measure her respiratory rate without detecting the pulse. Kudos to Phillips to achieve that.
            </p> 
            <p>
                Using machines to monitor my grandmother for signs of life was reasonable since there were
                long periods where no one was at her bedside. But I could not understand the fixation to 
                obtain Blood pressure readings even when it was obvious she was at death's door. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I was shocked one afternoon, after coming back from lunch to find a group of nurses 
                and a crash cart at her bedside. They were panicking because her pulse was unmeasurable
                using the regular pulse oximeter (Welch Allyn). If it wasn't involving my grandmother,
                I would have thought it was hilarious that they panicked, despite my grandmother was
                still obviously breathing (or Cheyne-Stoke gasping). There is a reason why breathing
                is checked before pulse before commencing CPR. Because no breaths, then check pulse.
                If there's breaths, there is always a pulse (weak/regular/irregular etc).
            </p>
            <p>
                And worse they asked me to not interfere when I already
                specified no interventions. I was familiar with the BP cuff, and saw it strapped to my 
                grandmother's thigh, and they still denied that they were not measuring her BP. If I was
                not a trained medical professional, I would have believed them blindly. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The nurses were very focused in getting the vital observation numbers because they
                seem really pressured by the primary care team to get those numbers. This was really 
                frustrating for me because I had already told the team, and then spoke to the 
                consultant during 1 ward round to specify no unnecessary measurements. Stop BP measurements, 
                stop oxygen saturation measurements since she was already on maximum non-invasive O2 
                supplementation. 
            </p>
            <p>
                It frustrated me more when staff keep giving me the reply that it is in the protocol.
                It is as if that patients are all treated the same, protocol is to be blindly followed 
                without thought and consideration for each patient's unique circumstances. What is the point
                of all the medical training, healthcare training, if all they do in the end is follow protocol 
                without thinking the rationale for each decision they make other than it is protocol?
                Artificial intelligence can take over if this continues since machines are a lot better at
                abiding to protocols. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Another thing that frustrated me was the need for ECG as part of death certification in
                Singapore public hospitals. It is quite a common phenomenon for patients to stop 
                breathing, and the heart continues pulseless electrical activity for a few hours, 
                before reaching asystole. This is quite distressing for family members to wonder 
                why the doctor is not certifying death when their loved one is already obviously
                turning cold. Only because the doctor is waiting for the ECG rhythm to show asystole. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I have been on the other side of certifying death, and it was difficult to explain
                to distraught family members that I couldnt give them a death certificate even thought
                it is obvious the patient was dead.

                My grandmother's case was the ideal case for this. My mother had reached her limit with caring for her at 
                home with 1 domestic helper. We just wanted her to be listed and transferred to institutional care.
                But because of a cavitating lesion found in a upper lobe of lung 
                (I still dont know which side, because the doctors
                are not great at sharing details), there is high suspicion of pulmonary TB.
            </p>
            <p>
                That threw a curveball in discharge disposition, because there was no institutional care that was allowed
                to accept someone with presumed active TB. 
                Nor did we have the option to get home hospice services arranged if discharged home.
                If we refused TB treatment, she would be regarded as discharged at own risk, back home without any
                home hospice services arranged because home hospice services cannot expose their staff to
                someone with presumed untreated active TB. There is no option to discharge untreated presumed 
                active TB into institutional care even if patient
                is frail and death is imminent within 6 months
            </p>
            <p>
                The only viable option was to subject my frail grandmother to TB treatment regime, which is 6-9 months, 
                and consist of antibiotics that are known to be toxic to kidneys, liver and eyes. She already had
                very limited end-organ functional reserve. I had to choose the path of accelerated death for 
                my grandmother due to iatrogenic causes. 
                Which is the TB treatment regime. 
            </p>
            <p>
                My grandmother probably will die with TB, instead of TB. Cause of death would be 
                advanced dementia, with multi-organ failure secondary to TB treatment toxicity.
            </p>
            <p>
                That wasn't the only heartbreaking thing. If we choose the route of getting the TB treatment, then it 
                would also include getting specimens to test for PTB, and if present, also for culture and antimicrobial
                sensitivities. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Getting the specimens had 2 options: sputum induction or gastric lavage. Since sputum induction would 
                require the patient's competence to follow instructions, that option is not valid due to my grandmother's
                advanced dementia. So gastric lavage it is. 
            </p>
            <p>
                That involved the insertion of a nasogastric tube through the nostril, down the pharynx into the gastric 
                pouch and likely an X-ray to confirm correct site. So I had to put my grandmother through this invasive
                procedure, something that I really wished I did not have to do.
            </p>
            <p>
                Fortunately, my grandmother was too frail to attempt pulling out the NGT, so it stayed in for 4 days 
                without requiring a repeat insertion. Every morning, an NG aspirate was taken and sent to the lab for TB
                testing. 1 of the specimens was of low quality, so needed a redo, hence the 4 days instead of 3.
            </p>
            <p>
                In summary, there is no room in Singapore for palliation in presumed active TB patients. 
                    All need to undergo treatment even if goals of care is comfort only.

            <h2>
                Most Doctors here have poor communication skills - like a low-performing LLM
            </h2>
            <p>
                Talking to most doctors in public healthcare system as a family member or patient is like pulling teeth. 
                Heck, I think pulling teeth is more straightforward. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Every time I ask an open-ended question, what is the palliative management plan, I never get the full 
                story and/or considerations. It's just answers like, here we just use subcut fentanyl. 

                Uh, no, I have some experience with palliative patients, and that cannot be true. Only when pushed
                further for details, akin to giving single-shot or few-shot prompts to a LLM, then I get a much 
                more well-rounded answer.
            </p>
            <p>
                Another way to get answers is by asking targeted questions. 
                But even then, most doctors here can be quite reticent to share more information.
                So usually you get the bare minimum unless you know exactly what to ask for.
