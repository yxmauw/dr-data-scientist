            <p>
                As a bright-eyed optimistic young doctor who had worked in Australia, I was excited to work
                in Singapore public healthcare to contribute my knowledge, training and work style. 
            </p>
            <p>
                When I was told my first rotation was General medicine in Khoo Teck Puat Hospital, I thought, 
                oh that's ok, I had enjoyable times doing general medicine when I was in Australia. Learnt
                a lot from patients and staff (seniors, peers, allied health)
            </p>
            <p>
                Later did I knew from the first week, the experience was entirely different. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I had a rude culture shock. Not only did most consultants not welcome my questions, they
                did not welcome any input. I could not clarify any rationale of their decisions, and
                was just told to do as they say. There was no mutual respect between junior drs and 
                the seniors, and even worse, no respect between allied health and doctors.
            </p>
            <p>
                Allied health were made to treat doctors as Gods, that doctors knew everything and
                allied health was just there to carry out orders.
            </p>
            <p>
                I was appalled by the entire culture. I was shocked when allied health looked at me
                strangely whenever I asked them about their opinion regarding a patient's care. 
                Pharmacists thought I was strange to ask for their opinion regarding medication regimes for patients
                given their unique physiology and presenting problems. Their answer was always: 
                "you are the doctor, shouldn't you already know this?" 
            </p>
            <p>
                It was a dystopian world. My reply would always be some where along the lines of, 
                "Yes, I am the doctor, I am trained as a doctor. But I am not trained as a pharmacist/
                dietitian/speech pathologist/occupational therapist/nurse. 
                You are a specialist in your own right, so tell me what is your opinion
                so that I can make a better decision for the patient?"
            </p>
            <p>
                The sad part was, because the oppressive culture was so ingrained, they no longer formed opinions. 
                Their reply would usually be "no opinion, nothing to say". For whatever reason, 
                they stopped taking 
                ownership and pride in their unique roles surrounding patient's care. And I knew patients' 
                were losing out on the best care they could have if not for this culture.
            </p>
            <p>
                Another big issue is
            </p>
            <hr class="separator">
            <h2 id="section2">The hospital admission</h2>
            <p>
                Got the news one Thursday evening that my grandmother was admitted to a public hospital in Singapore. Oh,
                it was triggered by carer's fatigue, but posed as possible lung infection to instil perceived severe condition 
                to get priority. (well, she did have lung infection, so it is not entirely wrong)
            </p>
            <p>
                My mother (carer) was not clear with the goals of care, so the doctors covered their bases a.k.a 
                defensive medicine. 
                I got mad about the interventions done, so I took over the decision-making. Worse luck, she could not be
                discharged to institutional care because she might have active pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB). 
            </p>
            <p>
                It has been a long journey that ended on 18 May 2024. Emotions have been on a roller-coaster ride. 
                Here are my thoughts so far:
            </p>
            <hr class="separator">
            <h3>Staff think they know better, but they not always get it right, so speak up</h3>
            <p>
                If you want anything to change in your or famiily member's management plan / interventions / monitoring 
                measures, 
                you need to speak to the consultant directly. No nursing staff, allied health or junior doctor is
                gonna advocate for you/your family member better than you. They are too afraid to offend the 
                consultant because their performance review depends on it.
            </p>
            <p>
                Best way to speak to the consultant is to catch them during ward rounds. Ward rounds are usually in the
                morning, starting 7.30am and can last until lunch time depending on case load and disruptions. Some consultants
                like having a 2nd ward round before the end of day, but depends on ward culture. My personal experience is
                9am - 9.30am in isolation ward.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can try calling the hospital hotline (switchboard) to reach the doctor (any doctor in the team), but 
                the best I have gotten is the ward nurse. It was a useless endeavour. Basically a patronising template answer
                about protocol.
            </p>
            <hr class="separator">
            <h4>
                Lack of continuity of care - why do I need to keep repeating myself?
            </h4>
            <p>
                In the isolation ward, consultants are rotated every week. Maybe that is the hospital's way to minimise
                infection risk to staff. 
            </p>
            <p>
                So far, the EMR must be doing something right since pertinent points about my family member's case do seem
                to get across from team to team. But when it comes to things that don't fit in the nice picture of "protocol",
                then the communication breaks down. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Why? Because purpose of EMR is not so much about making sure care is transferred seamlessly, but to ensure 
                that staff is covered medicolegally if there are litigations. Everything in EMR has to be politically correct,
                or else the hospital is basically going to throw you under the bus if you get into trouble.
            </p>
            <p>
                Another unique perspective since I am trained as a medical doctor, is that such practice of rotating doctors 
                so frequently deprives junior doctors the opportunity to learn firsthand about longitudinal case histories.
                Yeah they can read about them when preparing for case presentations, but nothing is quite the same as
                actually interacting with the patient and their family throughout their hospital journey.
            </p>
            <p>
                I think junior drs here are still rotated around consultants and their specialty, 
                so if a consultant change, the junior drs will follow him/her to whichever are the 
                new cases assigned to that consultant.
            </p>
            <p>
                I know I learnt more when I got to follow patients through their health journey. 
                It gave me a more holistic picture about what good medical practice should be.

                Death in inpatient setting is traumatic for both patient and family - even if it is anticipated
            </h6>
            <p>
                Hospital protocols are really sticky, they are great most times, but when it comes to respecting family 
                members' wishes for how they want their loved one to die, these protocols are a pain to deal with.
            </p>
            <p>
                Vital signs such as body temperature, pulse rate, respiratory rate, non-invasive blood pressure, oxygen 
                saturations are regularly measured in the hospital because they are the most basic way to monitor patient's 
                response to treatment. In patients with the goal to cure, or at least reach a baseline that can be managed 
                in the community, this would be appropriate.
            </p>
            <p>
                My grandmother was cachexic, with stage 5 renal failure. Not a candidate 
                for dialysis, transplant or even surgery. 
                Anyway, at the start of admission, my mother was not clear about
                what she wanted, so the medical team treated my grandmother with the goal to cure.
            </p>
            <p>
                So they did a bunch of tests - blood tests, chest X-ray.
                And they saw anaemia and thrombocytopaenia. 
                So they did a CT-scan without contrast to look for overt internal haemorrhage.
                Concurrently, they also transfused her with platelets, which promptly crashed her systolic BP. 
                Fortunately her BP responded to fluid resuscitation. However with her advanced renal failure, she
                probably would not tolerate another round of transfusion and fluid resuscitation.
                Eventually they managed to complete the tranfusion, likely at a slower rate (I wasnt there to witness)
            </p>
            <p>
                My grandmother didn't enjoy that day. 
                She had nightmares that night, and constantly felt cold despite 2 blankets. 
            </p>
            <p>
                It bugged me a lot thinking about the rationale for the CT scan. She is not a surgical candidate, so what
                if they found a bleed? what are they going to do about it? Will it change the management plan?
            </p>
            <p>
                And then there was the repeat blood test to check if she responded to platelet transfusion. 
                Already she did not tolerate the first transfusion well, any repeated transfusion is probably more a risk 
                than a benefit.
            </p>
            <p>
                So why do you need to check for response to platelet transfusion if nothing can be done even if it showed poor
                response?
            </p>
                I got mad about the entire saga of seeming unnecessary investigations, and lack of satisfactory explanations 
                given by the clinical staff to my mother. So I took over the communications with the medical team to get
                better accountability from them. 
            </p>
            <hr class="separator">
            <h7>
                Treat the patient, not the numbers.
            </h7>
            <p>
                It is ok not to measure BP in someone who is dying and goals of care does not include 
                resuscitative measures - be confident in using presence of pulse and breathing, 
                pupillary response to light, and response to pain/voice/touch as signs of life for monitoring.
                Ok so maybe you can't feel the radial pulse, try the carotid pulse. If all else fails, take the 
                stethoscope and auscultate for heart sounds.
            </p>
            <p>
                It is ok not to measure the oxygen saturation when there is peripheral circulatory shutdown, the
                patient is already on maximal non-invasive ventilation and for palliation. Especially when 
                the oxygen saturation becomes unmeasurable via pulse oximetry. No point pursuing getting a number. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Use oxygen supplementation for hypoxaemia. But it may not relieve dyspnoea in end-of-life.

            <p>
                My grandmother's case was the ideal case for this. My mother had reached her limit with caring for her at 
                home with 1 domestic helper. We just wanted her to be listed and transferred to institutional care.
                But because of a cavitating lesion found in a upper lobe of lung 
                (I still dont know which side, because the doctors
                are not great at sharing details), there is high suspicion of pulmonary TB.
            </p>
            <p>
                That threw a curveball in discharge disposition, because there was no institutional care that was allowed
                to accept someone with presumed active TB. 
                Nor did we have the option to get home hospice services arranged if discharged home.
                If we refused TB treatment, she would be regarded as discharged at own risk, back home without any
                home hospice services arranged because home hospice services cannot expose their staff to
                someone with presumed untreated active TB. There is no option to discharge untreated presumed 
                active TB into institutional care even if patient
                is frail and death is imminent within 6 months
            </p>
            <p>
                The only viable option was to subject my frail grandmother to TB treatment regime, which is 6-9 months, 
                and consist of antibiotics that are known to be toxic to kidneys, liver and eyes. She already had
                very limited end-organ functional reserve. I had to choose the path of accelerated death for 
                my grandmother due to iatrogenic causes. 
                Which is the TB treatment regime. 
            </p>
            <p>
                My grandmother probably will die with TB, instead of TB. Cause of death would be 
                advanced dementia, with multi-organ failure secondary to TB treatment toxicity.
            </p>
            <p>
                That wasn't the only heartbreaking thing. If we choose the route of getting the TB treatment, then it 
                would also include getting specimens to test for PTB, and if present, also for culture and antimicrobial
                sensitivities. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Getting the specimens had 2 options: sputum induction or gastric lavage. Since sputum induction would 
                require the patient's competence to follow instructions, that option is not valid due to my grandmother's
                advanced dementia. So gastric lavage it is.

                That involved the insertion of a nasogastric tube through the nostril, down the pharynx into the gastric 
                pouch and likely an X-ray to confirm correct site. So I had to put my grandmother through this invasive
                procedure, something that I really wished I did not have to do.
            </p>
            <p>
                Fortunately, my grandmother was too frail to attempt pulling out the NGT, so it stayed in for 4 days 
                without requiring a repeat insertion. Every morning, an NG aspirate was taken and sent to the lab for TB
                testing. 1 of the specimens was of low quality, so needed a redo, hence the 4 days instead of 3.
            </p>
            <p>
                In summary, there is no room in Singapore for palliation in presumed active TB patients. 
                    All need to undergo treatment even if goals of care is comfort only.

                Toxic work culture so patients suffer
            </h9>
            <p>
                This is something that bugged me when I joined the public health system as a medical officer. And
                the contributing factor to me leaving.
            </p>
            <p> 
                I worked in Australia as a doctor before, there were ups and downs. But one thing that really helped me
                become a better doctor was being supported by the staff around me, not just the superiors but also the 
                allied health and nursing staff. When I had to work late because a registrar was not helpful in finishing
                his rounds with a subset of patients under our team's care, the nurses lodged a formal complaint on my 
                behalf just because they saw me after work hours.
            </p>
            <p>
                Superiors were more than happy to answer any questions regarding their management plans. Sometimes they
                even adjusted plans based on the junior drs' input. 
            </p>  
            <p>
                Such support is sorely missing in the Singapore public health system. There is just hierachy, with a lot
                of blaming that goes around. No one dares to speak up to one higher in rank because of fear of retaliation.
            </p>
            <p>
                When I was still in the system, I saw situations where doctors who have finished their 36 hour (full-call) 
                shift, left the hospital, resting or sleeping at home or something, being called up by the primary care 
                team for something trivial because he/she made a decision for a patient admitted under their team that
                deviated from the consultant's plan. And the call was not to educate the dr that was off-work, it was
                to chastise without telling he/she why the decision he/she made was wrong.
            </p>
            <p>
                This resulted in a common practice for medical officers, registrars and even house officers to have 2
                phone subscriptions, so that 1 could be turned off when they are off-work. And so they won't be subjected 
                to useless berating sessions.
            </p>
            <p>
                The worse part is these berating sessions are usually not even conducted by the consultant him/herself, but
                carried out by the minions because they were told to do so. Or they were berated first, and then were asked
                to convey the same to the colleague that is already off-work. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Now that is just childish, if you have a problem with someone, especially someone of lower-rank, 
                communicate directly instead of getting your minion to do your dirty work. 
            </p>
            <p>
                So staff morale is low, everyone is being defensive, afraid to get it wrong. The only one who has clear
                insight about why investigations and interventions are done to the patient is the consultant. Everyone else
                just has piecemeal information, and the patient and the family get the leftovers. 
            </p>
            <p>
                So the family nor the patient can't really comment about their treatment plan because they don't have the 
                full picture about what is happening to them. Unless they are fortunate enough to have some insider 
                knowledge, themselves having worked in the system, or a family member who has worked in the system or still
                working in the system.
            </p>
            <p>
                It becomes a top-down approach to treatment plans design, and the consultant escapes with minimal 
                accountability unless there is overt medical negligence or foul play. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Even for my situation, I can only settle for being unhappy that my grandmother is being treated just like
                any other case on the consultant's list. My insider knowledge gave me the power to know what is just 
                bullsh*t and what was truly necessary. Even then, it was still a struggle to ensure my requests were 
                followed to ensure the best interests of 
                my grandmother because it wasn't the consultant that I could speak to directly. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Nursing staff were too afraid to trouble the doctors, or even to ask the Drs to speak to me directly when
                I objected to unnecessary investigations, tests, and measurements. Junior Drs were too afraid to 
                convey my wishes to the consultant. And asking to speak to the consultant directly is also not possible.
                How ridiculous is that?
            </p>
            <p>
                And only when I talked to the consultant directly during ward round, then the 
                consultant agreed to my requests. The only flaw was that it didnt translate to consistent following of 
                instructions because everyone was just so focused on not deviating protocol so that they dont get 
                into trouble with the consultant.

                Lack of communication within staff so patients suffer
            </h10>
            <p>
                So what you say, isn't there EMR to rely on? Yeah news flash, medical records are more for medicolegal 
                defence
                rather than ensuring useful transfer of information. Yes the information is still useful to train 
                machine learning
                algorithms and fancy LLMs. But that was not the main purpose. 
            </p>
            <p>
                A lot of useful information regarding a patient's care often get ommited in writing because it is not
                "politically correct". Information like family dynamics, patient's personality quirks, tips and tricks 
                to increase patient's compliance to treatment, often is ommitted. 
            </p>
            <p>
                 Nurses and junior drs seem to fear going against consultants. 
                 Or even to voice a different opinion or to advocate for family wishes. 
                 That hasn't changed since I last left the system. Quite unfortunate.
                 Patients are the ones left to suffer. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Asking nurses and junior staff for rationale behind management decisions is useless. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Why do you need to keep measuring BP in someone whose BP you are not going to treat? Oh because it is
                protocol and the dr wants it. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I want to speak to the dr who wants it. Uh....
            </p>
            <p>
                How about, you just document that patient's family made this request against the dr's wishes. 
                Then you will be legally covered. Or you could just let me speak with this Dr directly. 

                Uh....
            </p>
            <p>
                Junior drs don't learn the rationale behind decisions made by senior drs, 
                    which would help them in forming their internal compass about what kind of Dr 
                    they would want to be.

                Protocol-driven rather than patient-centred
            </h11>
            <p>
                I get the benefits of protocols. Streamlined processes. Less cognitive load, like being an assembly
                line worker. Efficiency is optimised.
            </p>
            <p>
                But we are not cars. Medicine is not about treating machines, but humans. and no 1 human is exactly alike. 
                Not even identical twins. Even clones can still have spontenous mutations harboured within them. Anyway
                human clones don't exist yet (I hope not).
            </p>
            <p>
                So stop treating protocols like rules that cannot be broken, instead, use them
                as a reference point, and tailor management plans to each patient's unique 
                physiology, needs and goals of care.
            </p>
            <p>
                I noticed staff fixation on following protocols. Maybe because of the strong blame-culture where
                if protocols were not followed, there were repercussions without 
                people imposing the punishment first understanding the situation.
                Like shoot first, ask questions later sort of practice. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I found myself questioning rationale behind many actions driven by protocol. Why do you need an ECG
                trace to figure out if the patient is dead? Is absence of breathing, heart sounds/central pulse for
                more than 5 minutes, absence of 
                pupillary response 
                to light, no response to touch/voice/pain (central painful stimulus) 
                more than enough to certify death, and the obvious sign of 
                body becoming ambient temperature enough to know he/she is dead?
            </p>
            <p>
                The common cop-out reason given for decision rationale is because it is the "institution" protocol.
                That is not a valid rationale, because all decisions can be altered if the situation is 
                deemed suitable or change requested
            </p>

                Most Doctors here have poor communication skills - like a low-performing LLM
            </h12>
            <p>
                Talking to most doctors in public healthcare system as a family member or patient is like pulling teeth. 
                Heck, I think pulling teeth is more straightforward. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Every time I ask an open-ended question, what is the palliative management plan, I never get the full 
                story and/or considerations. It's just answers like, here we just use subcut fentanyl. 

                Uh, no, I have some experience with palliative patients, and that cannot be true. Only when pushed
                further for details, akin to giving single-shot or few-shot prompts to a LLM, then I get a much 
                more well-rounded answer.
            </p>
            <p>
                Another way to get answers is by asking targeted questions. 
                But even then, most doctors here can be quite reticent to share more information.
                So usually you get the bare minimum unless you know exactly what to ask for.

                Lack of empowerment to junior staff and allied health, so patients suffer
            </h13>
            <p>
                Culture of hierachy is strong within the hospital. It is not a bad thing when it
                does not inhibit communication and exchange of ideas/opinions/input between allied / junior
                staff and consultants. Because it gives a guide to workflow, and clarity to
                levels of accountability.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, in Singapore public healthcare system, the culture of hierachy has poisoned
                the system, such that there's mainly a one-way communication top-down. 
            </p>
                <li>
                    Nursing staff can learn fast when empowered.
                </li>
               
        
                <li>Another tip: protocols/guidelines are first point of reference for Drs to use to reduce cognitive load. 
                    But what they do with the reference is entirely their choice, be it likened to a machine learning 
                    algorithm, following everything by the book without considering the patient's/family's POV or 
                    being an empathetic clinician that cannot be replaced by artificial intelligence.</li>
                <li>Treat the patient, not the numbers</li>
                <li>Guidelines cover standard and/or ideal situations. When is medicine practice ever ideal or involve
