            <h1>The hospital admission</h1>
            <p>Got the news one Thursday evening that my grandmother was admitted to a public hospital in Singapore. Oh,
                it is because of carer's fatigue, but posed as possible lung infection to instil perceived severe condition 
                to get priority. My mother (carer) was not clear with the goals of care, so the doctors covered their bases. 
                I got mad about the interventions done, so I took over the decision-making. Worse luck, she could not be
                discharged to institutional care because she might have active pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB). So far, it has 
                been a prolonged journey, and the end is not yet reached. Here are my thoughts so far:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Talking to nursing staff and junior doctors is useless 
                    if wanna change anything in management plans. Need to speak to consultant. </li>
                <li>Can only speak to consultant during ward round. If u r lucky. Best luck is between 9 and 9.30am</li>
                <li>Isolation room ambient temperature is customisable. 
                    So it doesn't have to be freezing for little old ladies</li>
                <li>It is ok not to measure BP in someone who is dying and goals of care does not include 
                    resuscitative measures - be confident in using presence of pulse and breathing, 
                    pupillary response to light, and response to pain/voice/touch as signs of life for monitoring.</li>
                <li>Use Oxygen supplementation for absolute hypoxaemia. 
                    It does not help with distress from dyspnoea in end of life. That needs something else. </li>
                <li>There is no room in Singapore for palliation in presumed active TB patients. 
                    All need to undergo treatment even if goals of care is comfort only. </li>
                <li>Nurses and junior drs seem to fear going against consultants. 
                    Or even to voice a different opinion or to advocate for family wishes. 
                    That hasn't changed since I last left the system. Quite unfortunate.
                    Patients are the ones left to suffer. </li>
                <li>Asking nurses and junior staff for rationale behind management decisions is useless. </li>
                <li>Why is the treatment 9 months instead of 6 months?</li>
                <li>Why do you need to keep measuring BP in someone whose BP you are not going to treat? </li>
                <li>Why do you need to transfuse red cells if 
                    you are not going to fix the source of bleedinf for a non-surgical candidate?</li>
                <li>Why do you need to check response to platelet transfusion if 
                    you know she cannot tolerate a repeat transfusion?</li>
                <li>Junior drs don't learn the rationale behind decisions made by senior drs, 
                    which would help them in forming their internal compass about what kind of Dr 
                    they would want to be. </li>
            </ol>
