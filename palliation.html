            <h1>The hospital admission</h1>
            <p>
                Got the news one Thursday evening that my grandmother was admitted to a public hospital in Singapore. Oh,
                it was triggered by carer's fatigue, but posed as possible lung infection to instil perceived severe condition 
                to get priority. (well, she did have lung infection, so it is not entirely wrong)
            </p>
            <p>
                My mother (carer) was not clear with the goals of care, so the doctors covered their bases a.k.a 
                defensive medicine. 
                I got mad about the interventions done, so I took over the decision-making. Worse luck, she could not be
                discharged to institutional care because she might have active pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB). 
            </p>
            <p>
                So far, it has 
                been a long journey, and the end is not yet reached. Emotions have been on a roller-coaster ride. 
                Here are my thoughts so far (Sorry if it offends some of you, hard truths are hard to hear):
            </p>
            <h2>Staff think they know better, but they not always get it right, so speak up</h2>
            <p>
                If you want anything to change in your or famiily member's management plan / interventions / monitoring 
                measures, 
                you need to speak to the consultant directly. No nursing staff, allied health or junior doctor is
                gonna advocate for you/your family member better than you. They are too afraid to offend the 
                consultant because their performance review depends on it.
            </p>
            <p>
                Best way to speak to the consultant is to catch them during ward rounds. Ward rounds are usually in the
                morning, starting 7.30am and can last until lunch time depending on case load and disruptions. Some consultants
                like having a 2nd ward round before the end of day, but depends on ward culture. My personal experience is
                9am - 9.30am in isolation ward.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can try calling the hospital hotline (switchboard) to reach the doctor (any doctor in the team), but 
                the best I have gotten is the ward nurse. It was a useless endeavour. Basically a patronising template answer
                about protocol.
            </p>
            <h3>
                Lack of continuity of care - why do I need to keep repeating myself?
            </h3>
            <p>
                In the isolation ward, consultants are rotated every week. Maybe that is the hospital's way to minimise
                infection risk to staff. 
            </p>
            <p>
                So far, the EMR must be doing something right since pertinent points about my family member's case do seem
                to get across from team to team. But when it comes to things that don't fit in the nice picture of "protocol",
                then the communication breaks down. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Why? Because purpose of EMR is not so much about making sure care is transferred seamlessly, but to ensure 
                that staff is covered medicolegally if there are litigations. Everything in EMR has to be politically correct,
                or else the hospital is basically going to throw you under the bus if you get into trouble.
            </p>
            <p>
                Another unique perspective since I am a trained medical doctor, is that such practice of rotating doctors 
                so frequently deprives junior doctors the opportunity to learn firsthand about longitudinal case histories.
                Yeah they can read about them when preparing for case presentations, but nothing is quite the same as
                actually interacting with the patient and their family throughout their hospital journey.
            </p>
            <p>
                I think junior drs here are still rotated around consultants and their specialty, 
                so if a consultant change, the junior drs will follow him/her to whichever are the 
                new cases assigned to that consultant.
            </p>
            <p>
                I know I learnt more when I got to follow patients through their health journey. 
                It gave me a more holistic picture about what good medical practice should be. 
            </p>
            <h4>
                Get comfortable - coz you are paying for it
            </h4>
            <p>
                Isolation room ambient temperature is customisable. 
                So it doesn't have to be freezing for little old ladies
            </p>
            
                <li>
                    It is ok not to measure BP in someone who is dying and goals of care does not include 
                    resuscitative measures - be confident in using presence of pulse and breathing, 
                    pupillary response to light, and response to pain/voice/touch as signs of life for monitoring.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    Nursing staff can learn fast when empowered.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    Use Oxygen supplementation for absolute hypoxaemia. 
                    It does not help with distress from dyspnoea in end of life. That needs something else. 
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    There is no room in Singapore for palliation in presumed active TB patients. 
                    All need to undergo treatment even if goals of care is comfort only. 
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    Nurses and junior drs seem to fear going against consultants. 
                    Or even to voice a different opinion or to advocate for family wishes. 
                    That hasn't changed since I last left the system. Quite unfortunate.
                    Patients are the ones left to suffer. 
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    Asking nurses and junior staff for rationale behind management decisions is useless. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Why is the treatment 9 months instead of 6 months?
                </li>
                <li>
                    Why do you need to keep measuring BP in someone whose BP you are not going to treat? 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Why do you need to subject frail old lady to a CT scan in search for overt internal bleed if
                   cannot fix the source of bleeding for a non-surgical candidate?
                </li>
                <li>
                    Why do you need to check response to platelet transfusion if 
                    you know she cannot tolerate a repeat transfusion?
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    Junior drs don't learn the rationale behind decisions made by senior drs, 
                    which would help them in forming their internal compass about what kind of Dr 
                    they would want to be. 
                </li>
                <li>You don't need an ECG to confirm biological death</li>
                <li>There should be an option for Euthanasia for cases like this</li>
                <li>I had to choose the path of accelerated death for my grandmother due to iatrogenic cause. 
                Which is TB treatment regime that are toxic to end-organs (eyes, liver, kidneys). 
                She had no functional reserve left in kidneys prior to treatment</li>
                <li>My grandmother probably will die with TB, instead of TB. Cause of death would be 
                advanced dementia, with multi-organ failure secondary to TB treatment toxicity</li>
                <li>There is no option to discharge untreated presumed active TB into institutional care even if patient
                is frail and death is imminent within 6 months.</li>
                <li>Singapore public healthcare system is protocol-driven rather than patient-centred</li>
                <li>Most Doctors here have poor communication skills</li>
                <li>Most Doctors here are very reticent to share information regarding patient's care unless 
                    pushed by patient/family to answer targeted questions</li>
                <li>Open-ended questions to most Doctors here do not yield useful answers, you got to know your s*t if you
                ever get to ask them anything</li>
                <li>The common cop-out reason given for decision rationale is because it is the "institution" protocol.
                Tip to public: that is not a valid rationale, because all decisions can be altered if the situation is 
                deemed suitable or change requested. </li>
                <li>Another tip: protocols/guidelines are first point of reference for Drs to use to reduce cognitive load. 
                    But what they do with the reference is entirely their choice, be it likened to a machine learning 
                    algorithm, following everything by the book without considering the patient's/family's POV or 
                    being an empathetic clinician that cannot be replaced by artificial intelligence.</li>
                <li>Treat the patient, not the numbers</li>
                <li>Guidelines cover standard and/or ideal situations. When is medicine practice ever ideal or involve 
                    dealing with "standardised" patients?</li>
